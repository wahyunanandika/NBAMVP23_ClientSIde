# NBA MVP 2023 Stats Client

## Deployed Url

```sh
https://nba-stat-ip-dika.web.app/
```

This project compares NBA MVP candidate 2022/2023 player stats (9 players in total).

I utilized both server-side and client-side programming for this project. Users must log in to view all player stats and subscribe (which is a prerequisite from my last bootcamp).

For the payment gateway, I used the Midtrans sandbox. If you create a new account, you need to subscribe first. You can refer to this link for completing the payment gateway setup:

```sh
https://docs.midtrans.com/docs/testing-payment-on-sandbox
```

However, if you want to check without registering, I can provide you with existing account credentials:
```sh
Email : test1234@gmail.com
Pass : test1234
```

Sometimes the webpage may not appear as intended. In that case, you can use this link to log in to the website:

Hope that helps ! :)
