This Project is for comparing NBA MVP candidate 2022/2023 Player Stats (Total 9 Players)

I use Server Side and Client Side for this project, you must be login to see all of the player' stats and subscribed (its a prequisite task from my last bootcamp).

for the payment gateway i use sandbox midtrans, if you make a new account, you need to subscribed first, i refer to this link for completing the payment gateway 

```sh
https://docs.midtrans.com/docs/testing-payment-on-sandbox
```

but if you wanna check without having to register, i can give you the existing account which is:

```sh
Email : test1234@gmail.com
Pass : test1234
```

sometimes the webpage wont appear as should be, u can use this link, to login to the website

```

```

Hope that helps ! :)
